I developed a PHP-based website connected to a MySQL database for the Poppleton Dog Show as part of a university project. Using a randomly generated dataset assigned to me from the provided SQL scripts (sourced from Brightspace), I set up and explored the database locally using XAMPP. The project involved writing raw PHP and SQL (without any frameworks) to retrieve and display information from the database based on specific requirements. This experience strengthened my understanding of relational databases, dynamic web content, and backend integration using PHP and MySQL.
